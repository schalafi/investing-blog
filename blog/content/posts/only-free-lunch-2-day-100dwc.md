# Diversity is Woke, and Bad for Investment , Right? The Only Feee Lunch in Investing  

## We can achieve the same level of returns diversifying our investments  

One important consideration while investing is related to the trade-off between **return** and **risk**.  
There exists one way to reduce **risk** and to keep the same **returns**.  

The so-called **diversifiable risk** could be avoided. The idea is to reduce the concentration on the same kind of assets  
and potentially get better **risk-adjusted** returns.  

Assets that move in the same way are correlated, so if they go down, all go down, and there is a risk of tinting red your portfolio.  
The opposite is also true, but there is no benefit in exacerbating the downside risk when you could get rid of it.
