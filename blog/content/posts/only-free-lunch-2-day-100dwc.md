# Diversity is Woke, and Bad for Investment , Right? The Only Feee Lunch in Investing  

## We can achieve the same level of returns diversifying our investments  

One important consideration while investing is related to the trade-off between **return** and **risk**.  
There exists one way to reduce **risk** and to keep the same **returns**.  

The so-called **diversifiable risk** could be avoided. The idea is to reduce the concentration on the same kind of assets  
and potentially get better **risk-adjusted** returns.  

Assets that move in the same way are correlated, so if they go down, all go down, and there is a risk of tinting red your portfolio.  
The opposite is also true, but there is no benefit in exacerbating the downside risk when you could get rid of it.

You need to understand average: Show how different investments perform over time 

How much is a lot of return?
How much is too little return?
Returns are really tricky: measuring in different time frames and with different risk and with changing time horizons 


The 50% return  investment: Stocks that have gone 50% or more in one year or less but they have other dark side.
