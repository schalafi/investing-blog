# How much is good retunr?
## Day 4
More than the `risk free rate` (around 3% anually) is considered good, and more than the `average market return` (approx 10%) is very good.

But what is the `risk free rate`?
It is the return with no risk or in practice minimal risk. It varies over time 
and its the return that offers the U.S. Treasury note, considered **risk free**, considered very secure and supported by the US goverment.

What is the `market return`? 
It is the average annual stock market return.
And we measure it by the S&P500 index average return.
In contrast to considering all the market stock we consider only the index of the 500 most important companies of the US.
Considering inflation the market return is around 6-7%. 

## Scammy returns
Everything that is beyond the 10% market return should be suspicios. 
Offering a 20% annual return means that in the fifth year they have payed you:  
**148.8%**

A crazy amount or return that came from some gold pot at the end of the rainbow.

**insert examples of scams** 
FTX

It's a common scenario getting extra potential return and riksing more.

Treasury notes vs stocks for example.
