In average, the stock market return (not adjusted for inflation) is — remember, in **average** — about 10%.  
Exactly, not always — be aware of that fluctuation. Planning is key for the sake of realizing good returns.  

In the year 2020, the **SPY** return was `18%`, much better than the 10% average return of the **SPY**.  

Then we had the tech layoffs in 2022.  
What happened to the market was a **HUGE** -18.17% — yes, minus 18.17% — losing almost 20% of its value, the **SPY** stock.  

Here is a breakdown of the return month by month for the 22nd year of the century:  

**Monthly breakdown for 2022 shows considerable variability:**  
- January: -5.54%  
- February: -3.12%  
- March: +4.14%  
- April: -9.11%  
- May: +0.21%  
- June: -8.74%  
- July: +9.41%  
- August: -3.41%  
- September: -8.72%  
- October: +6.96%  
- November: +4.50%  
- December: -6.01%  

Exactly what we observe is that overall **performance** matters a lot.  
If you are planning for the next years, it’s better to have positive returns and not be trapped in a bad year.  
It doesn’t matter if you started with 100% in the first year — you need to have the desired return at the moment you plan to use that money.  

This is the magic of the market: **Volatility**, both good and bad.  

You could feel very confident when you are having a good time with an 18% return, and then want to jump from the Burj Khalifa when entering the red zone of returns. One single year of bad returns could affect your confidence and maybe cause you to lose even more money by taking reckless actions during that period.  

The good news is that, on **AVERAGE**, the market provides you with positive returns — and even much better returns than real estate and other assets.  

You are not over-performing the market.

Returns are really tricky: measuring in different time frames and with different risk and with changing time horizons 


The 50% return  investment: Stocks that have gone 50% or more in one year or less but they have other dark side.
