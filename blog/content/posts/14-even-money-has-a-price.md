+++

Many things in this world can be bought — from basic needs like water, food, and clothes, to services like cleaning your car or house.  
Also, we all know the oldest profession in the world — it’s another thing that moves a lot of money.  

Then, on the other extreme, we have a variety of items you can acquire in video games — items that do not exist, and we don’t even know if they ever will.  
Like skins in **CS:GO**, emotes in **Fortnite**, or **Brainrots** in **Steal a Brainrot** (from Roblox).  

All of that is part of the trading ecosystem in the economy.  
But you can also get some **money** in exchange for paying more **money** in the future.  
For example, if you requested $1000, then you would need to pay $1100 next year — 10% interest.  

In a more abstract way, you would have paid:  
$1 + r$, where 1 is the principal value ($1000) and *r* is 0.1 or 10%.  

Even money has a **price** — the interest you pay to borrow it.  
The price of money, i.e., the annual percentage you need to pay to the lender, depends on the monetary policy dictated in the United States by the Federal Reserve (an independent institution separate from the government and private companies).  

If money is expensive, fewer businesses and people borrow money.  
But if it’s cheap, you can borrow without worrying too much about the interest.  

In this world, money can buy money — and that’s a useful piece of info if you plan to **invest**.
