For many people, he is one of the few known still-alive legendary investors —  
a man who has been beating the market for decades.  

I don't know how good the average person could get at investing.  
Maybe it’s extremely difficult; maybe you just need a good and simple strategy — buy and hold, maybe.  
Even that is very difficult to follow.  

**Warren Buffett**, *The Oracle of Omaha*,  
had a net worth of **1 million** in 1960 — yes, in the 60s, one dollar was a lot of money.  
Very unusual; building that kind of wealth at 30 made him a billionaire later on.  

Yes, that type of billionaire many people don’t believe exists — the one who didn’t exploit other people  
or inherit the wealth.  

We will be talking a lot about this legend; nonetheless, his story is inspiring me to pursue something similar.
