# Confirmation bias  

Often we find ourselves confirming our own beliefs.  
Story time: while visiting Facebook posts related to labor laws here in my country,  
I saw this marked pattern — someone posting about an **European** country getting the 4-day workweek.  
Again and again and again they post a new country with this benefit.  
But they totally ignore the bunch of other countries that are actually **raising** work hours or work days.  
Examples: Germany, France, South Korea, China with its “9-9-6” — from 9am to 9pm, 6 days a week.  

If you believe the future of work is the 4-day workweek, then you will only search for or find  
(maybe because the algorithms recommend it to you)  
information confirming that the “World” is moving toward that state.  

You find yourself in an information bubble, where you confirm your beliefs and the **world** works perfectly,  
with no complexities, and where there is only one path to follow.  
And, yeah… that’s pretty **bad** when you are investing.  

Imagine that you believe **Bitcoin** will reach $1M in 2030,  
and only that information reaches you — the **confirmation bias**  
is changing your perception of reality.  

It’s difficult to predict — not only the **Future** in general —  
you *can* predict **easily** that the USA and China will keep their economic dominance in 2030,  
but predicting the price target of an asset is much more difficult.  
It depends on a lot of factors, and you would also need  
a lot of black swans to occur in a short period.  

Many good things need to happen to **Bitcoin** to be that valuable.  
I'm not betting strongly on that.  

Another thing you can rely on is that the **market** will perform, on **average**,  
with a 7% return. It is very probable — but not impossible —  
for it to crash in the next 10 years.  

Confirmation bias does not allow you to **weigh** correctly the events.  
It’s very **sus** when everything works **perfectly** as we thought.

The tragedy of commons: In investing, once a strategy is weel know no longer works

You are not over-performing the market. 

You need to understand average: Show how different investments perform over time 

How much is a lot of return?
How much is too little return?
Returns are really tricky: measuring in different time frames and with different risk and with changing time horizons 


The 50% return  investment: Stocks that have gone 50% or more in one year or less but they have other dark side.
