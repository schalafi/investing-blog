### The Number 50 is Magical  

Imagine your assets have risen 50%. For each 1 USD, now you have 1.50 USD.  
That's great! And if you again get another 50%, you will have the 50% extra from the 1.5, adding 0.75 dollars.  
With a great total of 2.25 USD for each dollar — that's incredible, a 125% return by "only" getting half each time.  

You would need to repeat approximately 9 times a return of 10%:  

$ (1.10)^9 - 1 = 1.357 $  

And with 50%:  

$ (1.5)^2 - 1 = 1.25 $  

Pretty nice if you are winning.  
But what will happen if you lose 50%?  
For each 1 USD, then you will have 0.5 USD.  
So, to reach the same level of wealth after losing half of your wealth,  
you would need at least a 100% return to start again with the same level of wealth.  

That's somewhat disappointing.  
The moral of the story is that **-50% isn’t the same as a +50% return.**
