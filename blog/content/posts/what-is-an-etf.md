An **ETF** (Exchange-Traded Fund) is a basket of assets that trades like a stock.  
It's one of the easiest ways to get **diversified exposure** to a market, because instead of buying hundreds of individual stocks, you can buy one ETF and instantly hold them all in the right proportions.

## Famous ETF Examples

Two of the most well-known ETFs are:

- **SPY (SPDR S&P 500 ETF)** â†’ Tracks the **S&P 500 Index**, which represents 500 of the largest U.S. companies.  
- **QQQ (Invesco QQQ Trust)** â†’ Tracks the **Nasdaq-100 Index**, focused on the 100 largest non-financial companies listed on the Nasdaq.

Both hold **many different stocks** in specific weights. For example:

| ETF | Top Holdings (2025) | Weight |
|-----|-------------------------------|----------------|
| **SPY** | Apple (AAPL) | ~7% |
|       | Microsoft (MSFT) | ~6% |
|       | Amazon (AMZN) | ~3% |
|       | NVIDIA (NVDA) | ~6% |
|       | Alphabet (GOOGL + GOOG) | ~4% |
| ...   | ~495 other companies | ~74% |
| **QQQ** | Microsoft (MSFT) | ~8% |

## Why ETFs Matter

- **Diversification**: One purchase gives you exposure to many companies.  
- **Liquidity**: You can buy and sell ETFs like a stock during market hours.  
- **Cost efficiency**: ETFs often have low fees compared to mutual funds.

ðŸ‘‰ For example, buying just one share of **SPY** means you indirectly own a piece of all **500 companies in the S&P 500**.  
Thatâ€™s a powerful way to invest without picking individual stocks.
