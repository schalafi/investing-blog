title = '13 Ai Bubble How to Survive'
+++


We are in an **AI** bubble — yes, we can be sure by seeing the circular investing happening in the tech industry.  
Even **Sam Altman** (OpenAI CEO) has acknowledged that the AI landscape is becoming more and more inflated.  
Companies are expecting to profit from this technology — many of them without a solid business model in place.  

Will it burst in 1 year, or 5 years, or 10 years? We don't know — and that’s the problem.  

Even if this doesn’t happen, and companies do manage to get profits from their AI investments,  
it might be because they replaced a lot of **human** workers.  

We can expect markets to bounce back to the average return of around **7%** (after discounting for inflation).  
Be prepared. Warning: scary word incomming: **diversification**, you would need a diversified portfolio to mitigate market risk and expect recovery in a few years.  

Focus on companies with good business models — those that are sustainable and robust to market shifts. 
You can start with Microsoft who survived the dot com bubble in the 2000s. 

One very useful tool if you are investing actively is the use of **stop-loss** orders.
Prepare your **mitigation risk** tools.  

## Bubbles are not the end of the world.  

Markets will keep operating and **probably** will recover completely.  

Many swtrategies can help you mitigate risk in the case of a bubble.  

Implement risk mitigation techniques as quickly and easily as you can.  
Even this could be a **great** opportunity to invest if valuations correct in the coming months or years.
