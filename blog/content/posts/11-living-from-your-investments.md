Is it even possible to live from your investments?  
In these modern times, when you feel everything is going up as quickly as a rocket to the moon, it seems impossible — or at least difficult.  

Apparently, even if that’s true in its strongest form, the market tends to outperform inflation.  
After discounting for inflation, the market return is approximately **6%**.  

Passive investment will require you to add money consistently and wait a long time.  

You could stick to the **4% rule** — withdraw 4% of your portfolio each year to live on that.  
If you need 40k per year, you would need around **1M** invested.  
And you know, 40k isn’t much these days — if not, ask Gen Z, who think they need to earn 500k annually to live comfortably.  
You’d need the small amount of **12.5M** invested — a very good accomplishment.  

Also, you need to consider the years when shocks hit your investments — as in 2022 with the **-18%**.  
In those years, you would need to spend less than 4% to support the negative returns and maybe other losses of income.  

Nonetheless, I think you could definitely live from your investments — but it’s not easy-peasy lemon squeezy.  
For me, a better approach is to **actively** invest and beat the market — even if that’s not by much — if done consistently, it could mean a big difference in some years from now.  

Obviously, the latter is not *“living from passive income/investments”* because you are working consciously and actively to earn that money.

You are not over-performing the market. 

You need to understand average: Show how different investments perform over time 

How much is a lot of return?
How much is too little return?
Returns are really tricky: measuring in different time frames and with different risk and with changing time horizons 


The 50% return  investment: Stocks that have gone 50% or more in one year or less but they have other dark side.
