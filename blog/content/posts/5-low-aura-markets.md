### Unbelievable Market Glitches and Bugs   

### Day 5  

There are well-known market inefficiencies and anomalies:  

- **Low-risk anomaly**: This first one is about the return-risk tradeoff. It's often said “better return, greater risk.” But actually, sometimes low-risk stocks (also known as low-beta stocks) outperform higher-risk stocks.  

- The so-called **January effect**: small-capitalization stocks tend to outperform in January.  

- **Momentum effect**: recent winners are more likely to keep winning, and recent losers are more likely to keep losing.  

- Some of these **anomalies** could form the basis of a trading strategy. For example, create a portfolio of low-risk stocks and hold it for some time.  

- One of the explanations for the **low-risk anomaly** is that people tend to overpay for popular and trending stocks, so those other boring or under-the-radar stocks are more stable and create consistent returns.  

- Finally, it is important to know that some **anomalies/inefficiencies** could be fixed when they are well-known.  
- So if you are planning to **trade** seriously, you will need to find and exploit new or recent **anomalies/inefficiencies**.  
- Some anomalies work only under certain conditions and may require specialized information or an edge in speed or execution.  

You need to understand average: Show how different investments perform over time 

How much is a lot of return?
How much is too little return?
Returns are really tricky: measuring in different time frames and with different risk and with changing time horizons 


The 50% return  investment: Stocks that have gone 50% or more in one year or less but they have other dark side.
